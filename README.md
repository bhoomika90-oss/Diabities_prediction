DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Machine Learning based system that predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using medical data. Early prediction of diabetes helps in better treatment and prevention.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Diabetes is a major health issue affecting people worldwide. Manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and may not always be accurate. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict diabetes based on patient health parameters.

DATASET
The project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Age
- Insulin
- Skin thickness

MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
Logistic Regression algorithm is used to train the model and perform predictions.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML and CSS
- Pickle

PROJECT WORKFLOW
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Saving trained model using Pickle
7. Web-based prediction using Flask application

OUTPUT
The system predicts whether the patient is:
- Diabetic
- Non-Diabetic

CONCLUSION
This Machine Learning based system helps in early detection of diabetes and provides accurate prediction results. It demonstrates the effective use of Machine Learning techniques in healthcare applications.
